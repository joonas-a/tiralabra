## Week 2

This week I researched into Tkinter/ttk to create the GUI for my application & maze generation.

### Progress on the application

UI is mostly finished, with probably few small additions still to be added. Currently the user can create an empty canvas (soon to be a maze) of any size.

### What I learned 

I learned a lot about Tkinter and it's different widgets. I still need to figure out how to split the canvas into smaller cells for upcoming mazes.

### What I'm doing next

After figuring out the canvas which shouldn't take long I can start working on implementing the first algorithm (Kruskal's or the Recursive backtracker).
The project structure is going to need some refactoring as well.

### Questions and other

None

### Time spent

Approx. 9 hrs
