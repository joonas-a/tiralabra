## Week 3

This week I restructured the application and started working on the first algorithm implementation.

### Progress on the application

Project structure was mostly redone to help adding new features easier later. Blank maze generation is now possible (=matrix of 0's).

### What I learned 

I researched into Kruskal's algorithm and how to go about implementing it along with the disjoint set data structure.

### What I'm doing next

I'm implementing the randomized Kruskal's algorithm to create mazes.

### Questions and other

I'm not sure about how to test this type of application as it currently only really consists of UI,
and even the upcoming algorithms only provide randomized mazes.

### Time spent

Approx. 10 hrs
