## Week 4

This week I finished implementing the randomized Kruskal's algorithm for maze generation.

### Progress on the application

Randomized mazes can now be generated either instantly or one step at a time in 30ms intervals. I decided to stick with a model where each cell
in the maze represents either a solid wall or a path, meaning the walls are the same size as the paths.

### What I learned 

Many hours were spent on studying implementation and fine adjustment of the algorithm. I also learned how to test maze generation algorithms in general.

### What I'm doing next

I'm finishing writing tests for the algorithm and starting to work on the recursive backtracker.

### Questions

None

### Time spent

18 hrs
