## Week 6

This week I worked on testing the application. Also more documentation was written.

### Progress on the application

Some unittests were written, some were left unfinished for time being.

### What I'm doing next

Testing for cycles within mazes with DFS caused some trouble so I need to get that sorted out. 
Afterwards the other algorithm (Randomized dfs) should be a walk in the park.

### Questions

The unittests will be testing for perfect maze (no cycles, solvable), will this be enough unittests or are there some other
aspects that need to be automatically tested? Some performance tests will also be conducted manually.

### Time spent

14 hrs including the peer review
