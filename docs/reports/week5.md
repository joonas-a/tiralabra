## Week 5

This week I didn't have much time to work with this project unfortunately, however the peer review for week 1 is done.

### Progress on the application

No real progress happened within the application. I have my goals set for the next week where I will have more time to work on the project.

### What I'm doing next

I will finish writing some tests along with the documents and get the other algorithm ready. Tests will check for any non-visited cells and perform a search through the maze to find whether it's solvable. Some improvements also need to happen as I noticed the performance of the application gets slower over time unless restarted. The peer review also brought up some suggestions that I might take into consideration if time allows me to.

### Time spent

3 hrs on this project, another 3-4 on the peer review.
