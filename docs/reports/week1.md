## Week 1

This week I spent most of my time on picking a topic and researching into it. 
I chose to stay with the maze generator topic from the course material.

### Progress on the application

I haven't started coding yet, but the application is going to be written in python using Tkinter library (which is new for me) for visualization.

### What I learned 

I watched videos and read blogposts about different maze generating algorithms and how the mazes they generate differ.

### What I'm doing next

I'm starting by getting the basic UI ready, as I feel like visualizing what's happening is top priority on this topic.

### Questions and other

Not at this time.

### Time spent

Approx. 4 hrs
