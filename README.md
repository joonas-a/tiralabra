# Maze Generator

Course repository for the Data Structures & Algorithms Lab at the University of Helsinki

This is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) project that uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management

## User instructions

Run `poetry install` in the project's root directory to install dependencies

### Invoke commands:

`poetry run invoke start` to launch the main application

- In the main application user can alter maze dimensions, by first inputting the dimensions and clicking 'set'.

- Mazes can be generated by clicking their representative button, and the animation can be toggled on/off by ticking the checkbox below.

- **Current limitations:** trying to generate a new maze while a previous one is still animating will cause multiple instances of maze generation to stack on top of
each other, and they will all try to draw on the same canvas. The canvas will be repaired once all algorithms stop visualizing, or alternatively by restarting the application.

`poetry run invoke performance` to run the CLI performance-testing application

`poetry run invoke lint` to check for internal code quality
